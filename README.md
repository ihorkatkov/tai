## What Can I Do? TLDR;

Stream market data to create and manage orders with a near-uniform API across multiple venues

Here's an example of an advisor that logs the spread between multiple products on multiple venues

[Planned Venues...](./PLANNED_VENUES.md)

## Install

`tai` requires Elixir 1.8+ & Erlang/OTP 21+. Add `tai` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:tai, "~> 0.0.43"}
  ]
end
```

Create an `.iex.exs` file in the root of your project and import the `tai` helper

```elixir
# .iex.exs
Application.put_env(:elixir, :ansi_enabled, true)

import Tai.CommandsHelper
```

## Usage

`tai` runs as an OTP application.

During development we can leverage `mix` to compile and run our application with an 
interactive Elixir shell that imports the set of `tai` helper [commands](#commands).

```bash
iex -S mix
```

## Advisors

Advisors are the brains of any `tai` application, they subscribe to changes in
market data to record and analyze data or execute automated trading strategies.

Orders are created and managed through a uniform API across exchanges, with 
fast execution and reliability.

Take a look at some of the [examples](./apps/examples) to understand what 
you can create with advisors.

## Configuration

Each environment can have its own configuration. Take a look at the [example dev configuration](config/dev.exs.example) 
for available options.

## Commands

To monitor your advisors, accounts and markets `tai` provides the following set of IEx commands.

## Logging

`tai` uses a system wide event bus and forwards these events to the Elixir 
logger. By default Elixir will use the console logger to print logs to `stdout` 
in the main process running `tai`.  You can configure your Elixir 
logger to format or change the location of the output.

For example. To write to a file, add a file logger:

```elixir
# mix.exs
defp deps do
  {:logger_file_backend, "~> 0.0.10"}
end
```

And configure it's log location:

```elixir
# config/config.exs
use Mix.Config

config :logger, :file_log, path: "./log/#{Mix.env()}.log"
config :logger, backends: [{LoggerFileBackend, :file_log}]
```

If you intend to deploy `tai` to a service that ingests structured logs, you 
will need to use a supported backed. For Google Cloud Stackdriver you can use `logger_json`

```elixir
# mix.exs
defp deps do
  {:logger_json, "~> 2.0.1"}
end

# config/config.exs
use Mix.Config

config :logger_json, :backend, metadata: :all
config :logger, backends: [LoggerJSON]
```

## Secrets

Managing secrets is a complex and opinionated topic. We recommend that you avoid compiling 
application secrets into your OTP release and regularly rotate them. This can be achieved in many 
different ways, `tai` has chosen to use [confex](https://github.com/Nebo15/confex) to manage 
this workflow. `confex` provides the ability to read secrets from environment variables or the 
file system out of the box. It also has the ability to read secrets from your any location you 
wish via a custom adapter.

Take a look at our example [dev configuration](./config/dev.exs.example#L32) which 
reads secrets from the file system.

## Help Wanted :)

If you think this `tai` thing might be worthwhile and you don't see a feature 
or venue listed we would love your contributions to add them! Feel free to 
drop us an email or open a Github issue.
